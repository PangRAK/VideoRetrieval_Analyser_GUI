# VideoRetrieval_Analyser_GUI
VideoRetrieval_Analyser_GUI_gradio


This project utilizes a Perception Encoder to extract visual features from video frames and compute their similarity to predefined prompts, enabling video content analysis. The system consists of two main components: `video_extractor.py` and `explainer.py`.

## Components

### 1. `video_extractor.py`

- Extracts video frames at 0.1-second intervals (10 FPS).
- Processes each frame using a Perception Encoder to generate visual feature maps.
- Saves the extracted features to `result/data.json`, where each entry corresponds to a frame and its encoded representation.

### 2. `explainer.py`

- Loads the `data.json` file generated by `video_extractor.py`.
- Computes similarity between the pre-extracted visual features and a list of user-defined prompts.
- Helps determine how closely each frame aligns with prompts (e.g., "fire", "fall down", "smoke").
